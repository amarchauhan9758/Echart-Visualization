#  Description 
Wine Data Visualization
This project visualizes the magnesium content of different types of wine using bar and scatter charts. The data set used in this project is the Wine Data Set, which contains the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in a specific area in Italy.

The bar chart displays the magnesium content of Red Wine, White Wine, Fratelli Sette, Sparkling Wine, and Yellow Wine. The x-axis represents the type of wine, while the y-axis represents the magnesium content. The colors of the bars are determined based on the screen size of the device used to view the chart.

The scatter chart displays the relationship between flavanoids and ash in the wine data set. The x-axis represents flavanoids, while the y-axis represents ash. The chart is interactive and allows users to zoom in and out, as well as hover over data points to view the corresponding values.

This project was built using React and ECharts, a powerful visualization library for JavaScript.
